Wano
====
Wano aims to be a portable nano clone that uses the familiar windows-like shortcuts.

Building

PDCurses .lib file in the `lib/` directory along with its headers.

Major TODOs
----
* ~~Create an event system~~ *DONE*
* Decouple textarea from document with event system
* Implement menus
* Convert project to CMAKE or GN or GYP.
