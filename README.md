Wano
====
Wano aims to be a portable nano clone that uses the familiar windows-like shortcuts.

Building
----
Wano has been built with VS2015 and Clang 3.4, but should be able to be built with any compiler that supports C++14. On Windows, Wano also requires a pre-compiled PDCurses .lib file in the `lib/` directory along with its headers.

Major TODOs
----
* Add functionality to menus (and shortcuts)
* Implement saving and loading
